# Cats vs Dogs Classification using ConvNN

In this paper, I created a convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs, using the kaggle cat and dog database.

First, I created a model from scratch and analyze the results and your metrics. The knowledge transfer method was then used, using the convolutional part of the Imagenet VGG16 pretrained network, to work various methods until the desired accuracy was achieved.

All the work was done in the kaggle framework, to use its GPUs, therefore the codes that work with directories are based on said framework.
